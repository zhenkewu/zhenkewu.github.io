# Abstract

This paper describes and illustrates the functionality of the **baker** `R` package. The package estimates a suite of nested partially-latent class models (NPLCM) for multivariate binary responses that are observed under a case-control design. The **baker** package allows researchers to flexibly estimate population-level class prevalences and posterior probabilities of class membership for individual cases that may also depend on explanatory covariates. Estimation is accomplished by calling a cross-platform automatic Bayesian inference software 
`JAGS` through a wrapper `R` function that parses model specifications and data inputs. The **baker** package provides many useful features, including data ingestion, exploratory data analyses, model diagnostics, extensive plotting and visualization options, catalyzing communications between practitioners and domain scientists. Package features and workflows are illustrated using simulated and real data sets.

**Keywords** Case-control studies, Latent class models, Measurement error, Markov chain Monte Carlo, `R`, `JAGS`
