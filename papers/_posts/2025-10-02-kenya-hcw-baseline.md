# TL;DR

New longitudinal data from Kenya show nearly half of healthcare workers met criteria for clinical depression over 1 year. Findings highlight the urgent need for culturally tailored mental health interventions among HCWs in LMICs. #[UZIMA-DS](https://uzimadatascience.org/)

# Abstract

The mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) is an important global health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Kenya where unique stressors may place them at disproportionate risk for depression. However, depression prevalence and risk factors are not well understood in this population. To address this gap, we utilize longitudinal data collected among Kenyan HCWs based on the well-established Intern Health Study protocol, to evaluate the prevalence of depressive symptoms and identify associated demographic, psychological, and workplace factors.
