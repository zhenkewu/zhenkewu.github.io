# Abstract

We address estimation of intervention effects in experimental designs in which (a) interventions are assigned at
the cluster level; (b) clusters are selected to form pairs, matched on observed characteristics; and (c) intervention is assigned
to one cluster at random within each pair. One goal of policy interest is to estimate the average outcome if all clusters in all
pairs are assigned control versus if all clusters in all pairs are assigned to intervention. In such designs, inference that ignores
individual level covariates can be imprecise because cluster-level assignment can leave substantial imbalance in the covariate
distribution between experimental arms within each pair. However, most existing methods that adjust for covariates have
estimands that are not of policy interest. We propose a methodology that explicitly balances the observed covariates among
clusters in a pair, and retains the original estimand of interest. We demonstrate our approach through the evaluation of the
Guided Care program.
