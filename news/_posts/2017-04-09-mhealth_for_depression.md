Frequent interactions of individuals with mobile devices have opened new doors to behaviorial and mental health research. The real-time individual-level data streams unleashed by mobile technologies have significantly improved the potential to capture the opportunistic windows during the day for maintaining healthy behaviors, push actionable suggestion messages, and help individuals develop and maintain long-term changes necessary to improve health. For the current project, we hope the privacy-protected data will ultimately refine our understanding of how life stress leads to depression and hence transform our ability to prevent and treat depression.
